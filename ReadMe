This project contains simple examples of geometric multigrid (GMG) solver and/or preconditioner application for the advection -- diffusion equations in 2D domain. 

AdvectionDiffusion_FD_Dirichlet - contains implementation of the finite difference method in [0;1] \times [0;1] domain.
AdvectionDiffusion_FD_Dirichlet - contains implementation of the pseudo spectral method in periodic [0;2\pi] \times [0;2\pi] domain.

Figures are supplied for author's paper.
